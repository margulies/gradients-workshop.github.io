## Frequently asked questions
---  
###### Can I bring a +1? 

Yes, and we can accomodate a limited number of rooms with double beds. When registering, please add an additional 'no accomodations' ticket to your order (to cover the venue and catering costs) and mention the +1 in the comments during checkout so we can accomodate when allocating rooms.  

###### I've registered, but won't be able to attend. Can I get a refund?  

At the moment, we cannot guarantee that refunds will be possible, but we will do our best to accomodate them closer to the event. If you need to transfer your registration to someone else, please let us know by email (contact email below).
