##### A note on registration fees

The registration fees are higher that usual this year and are set to reflect the actual costs of running the retreat. They include venue hire, accommodation, catering, and local arrival transportation. Château rooms and glamping have higher fees because they include on-site accommodations, while the commuter option covers only the workshop and food/drink. We have tried to keep the pricing as transparent and fair as possible, while ensuring that the event remains financially viable.

Following is a breakdown of the approximate costs associated with the meeting this year:  

- General venue rental is approximately 50€ per person  
- Catering for two days, including all meals, coffee/tea breaks, and evening drinks is approximately 250€ per person   
- Glamping per bed is 100€ per person  
- Indoor bed is 250€ per person  

We have aimed to keep the registration fees at cost for those registering by January 31<sup>st</sup>.
