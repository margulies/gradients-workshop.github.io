Recent years have seen a rise of new methods and applications to study smooth spatial transitions — or gradients — of brain organization. Identification and analysis of cortical gradients provides a framework to study brain organization across species, to examine changes in brain development and aging, and to more generally study the interrelation between brain structure, function and cognition. In this special pre-OHBM retreat, we will bring together outstanding junior and senior scientists to discuss the challenges and opportunities afforded by this emerging perspective.

Early career researchers will take centre stage for a series of talks on state-of-the-art development and application of gradient approaches, while a diverse range of established scientists from across the globe will chair the proceedings. In this manner, we hope to stimulate discussions on how gradients are changing our understanding of brain organisation and to initiate fellow researchers to this burgeoning field.  

The upcoming event will be the seventh annual Gradients in Brain Organization Workshop, with preivous events held virtually ({{<newtab text="2020" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2020.pdf">}}, {{<newtab text="2021" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2021.pdf">}}) as well as in {{<newtab text="Cambridge (2022)" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2022.pdf">}}, {{<newtab text="Montreal (2023)" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2023.pdf">}}, {{<newtab text="Seoul (2024)" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2024.pdf">}}, and {{<newtab text="Brisbane (2025)" href="/downloads/GradientsProgram_2025.pdf">}}.  

We have some very special surprises this year.
